Hi, my name is Victor Rafael Molon ✨

I'm 19 years old and I currently live in Joinville, SC, Brasil.

My goal is to switch my graduation to a tecnological area, i'm doing "accounting sciences",
but in the final of the last year, i jumped into this tec area, and find myself interested in programming.
So now, i have 2 goal, one been the change, and the other, learning, by courses, programs, orgs, and other ways.

I hope to enter in the market and get my first job  in this area, it would be like a dream ✨.
